Tight coupling:
i)classes and objects are dependent on one another i.e., commonly shared memory
ii)The degree of coupling between should be high.
iii)microprocessor cpu's are connected closely location to communication.
iv)cost is high.
v)cpu's shared the bus,memory and I/O devices.
vi)memory conflict are happend due to shared memory.
vii)processors are communicate with each other through shared memory.
Loose coupling:
i)It reduces dependencies of class.It is mostly independent i.e., distributed memory
ii)The degree of coupling between should be low.
iii)microprocessor cpu's are connected in different locations.
iv)cost is low
v)There is no such sharing.
vi)No memory conflict are occur.
vii)processors are communicate with each other through using message passing techinque.
